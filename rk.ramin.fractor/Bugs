Which design for scaling and rotating in the preview field?
What data should be shown?
Which snapping should be used?

Swap rotation direction in the preview-field?

Bugs:

Initially all 4 textFields contain the number 0.0, if you click at one of the SensorCanvasses, it changes to simply 0
Is it right that I can rightclick and midclick knobs without getting any focus? 

It is not really a bug but the only possibility to make the software also work on case-sensitive file systems: Only the lower case extension ".fractor" is accepted by this software

Further Ideas:

Snapping in the previewField also by zooming and rotating? Yes. ... ?
